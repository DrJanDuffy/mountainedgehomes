                            <p>The master-planned design of Mountain's Edge contributes significantly to its safety profile, with limited access points, good visibility on streets, and well-maintained common areas. Additionally, the strong sense of community and high rate of owner-occupied homes (approximately 75%) creates natural neighborhood vigilance.</p>
                            <p>Many residents cite safety as one of their primary reasons for choosing Mountain's Edge, particularly families relocating from other parts of the Las Vegas valley or from out of state.</p>
