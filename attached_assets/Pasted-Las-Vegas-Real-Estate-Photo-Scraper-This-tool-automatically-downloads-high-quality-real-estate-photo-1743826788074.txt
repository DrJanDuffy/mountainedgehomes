Important Notes

The free tier of Unsplash API has rate limits (50 requests per hour)
Always provide proper attribution for Unsplash photos as required by their license
For production use, consider upgrading to a paid Unsplash plan
This tool is meant for initial setup - for ongoing needs, consider a more sustainable solution

Troubleshooting

If you encounter rate limit errors, reduce the number of photos requested or wait an hour
If photos aren't downloading, check your API key and internet connection
For any errors, check the console output for detailed information

Legal Considerations
Always review the licensing terms for any images you use on your realtor website. While Unsplash provides free-to-use images, some may have specific attribution requirements or restrictions for commercial use.
