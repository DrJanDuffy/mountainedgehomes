Paradise on the outskirts of Las Vegas
At the foothills of the Spring Mountains in the southern part of the Las Vegas Valley is Mountain’s Edge. A 3,500-acre master-planned community steeped in history, today it's devoted to outdoor living with 700 acres dedicated to open green space, parks and trails. “If you want to feel like you’re on the outskirts of Las Vegas, Mountain’s Edge is a good option,” says Realtor Cody Corio of Knight Real Estate Group. Developed in 2004, this award-winning community is home to over 70 diverse neighborhoods with convenient access to top-notch schools, shopping centers and other amenities. This, with the lower price point, is why many chose to settle here over the neighboring Summerlin planned community. On top of that, Mountain’s Edge offers its residents a strong sense of community. “The community is what makes us so special; they always come out for our events, so I think that mix of community spirit and outdoor recreation we offer really sets us apart,” says Taylor Halama, Communications Manager, Mountain’s Edge Master Association.

A haven for outdoor enthusiasts
Residents are just minutes from four main parks. At the community's heart is Exploration Peak Park, often called “Fossil Hill” by paleontologists for the number of fossils discovered in the area. The 80-acre oasis packs in playgrounds, picnic areas, walking trails, a western town replica with a covered wagon play structure and an archeology dig site. As the name suggests, the park’s focal point is the 2,846-foot-high Exploration Peak. Hike or bike its trails for unmatched views of the Las Vegas Valley and to learn about the area’s geological and pioneer history from plagues at the top of the peak. “That’s the high point of Mountain’s Edge,” Halama says. “That’s where we hold our big festivals, too.”

Head to Mountain’s Edge Regional Park in the center of the community to play soccer, baseball or racquetball. The park also has a bike town with mini stop signs and crosswalks to teach children how to ride bikes safely. At its entrance, residents will find 15 to 26-foot rings, a first for the Las Vegas Valley, for a fun outdoor climbing experience. Or step up to the plate at Desert Diamonds Baseball Complex inside the park. Bring furry companions along to play at Nathaniel Jones Park or channel that inner Olympian on the sand volleyball courts at Paiute Park. “We have beautiful parks, but we also have three walking paseos sprinkled throughout the community that people can use for exercise or walk their dogs,” Halama says. The Mesa Trailhead is just 10 miles from the community, which leads to the 24,000-acre Rainbow Mountain Wilderness, Red Rock Canyon Overlook, and Spring Mountain Ranch State Park, a dream for cyclists and hikers.

An enclave of upscale homes for every budget
With over 60 subdivisions in Mountain’s Edge offers something for every style and budget, featuring Mediterranean and modern designs and newer builds. “There’s a wide range of homes,” Halama says. “It’s a diverse community, too, from renters to first-time home buyers to empty nesters. There's something for everyone, with amenities from kids' parks to walking trails. It’s a paradise for any potential buyer.” Most homes were built in the early 2000s and range from $380,000 to over $1 million. The community provides mostly two-story Spanish-style homes that get more elaborate depending on the price, as well as townhouses, tri-levels and custom mini estates. Some subdivisions are gated, like Madera and Cascade and boast amenities like heated pools, outdoor fireplaces and a community basketball court and playground. “Denali and Bella Monte are the two standout communities of Mountain's Edge,” Halama says. However, one of the largest subdivisions offering spacious homes is the non-gated Chaco Canyon. Homes range from 1,500 to 3,800 square feet. You can avoid staircases in Tularosa, a subdivision of all one-story homes up to 2,100 square feet. Or go in the opposite direction: Find three-story homes up to 3,300 square feet in Azure Canyon. If low-maintenance living appeals, the gated Beacon Hill townhouse subdivision offers a pool, park and fitness center; units here sell for up to $330,000 for 2,300 square feet. Throughout Mountain’s Edge, expect to pay between $500,000 and $650,000 for a three- to four-bedroom home and over $1 million for a five-bedroom semi-custom home. Townhouses average around $350,000 for a three-bedroom unit. Regardless of newcomers' needs or where they settle, they are treated to priceless city and mountain views. 12,500 homes.
